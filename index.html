	<h2>An Introduction: Olin Statistical Course Finder</h2>
	
	When the time for course registration rolls around, fear slowly rises through the depths of every student's heart. 
	Friends become enemies as they could snatch your supposed-to-be golden experience for the class you want to take
	so dearly. Such has been the cyclic history since the beggining of Olin. With the information this site offers, 
	students will be able to minimize that heartbreak by knowing beforehand the trends and statistics behind the course 
	registration process.


	<h2>Why Should You Use It?</h2>
	
	Most of the information collected by students to prepare for course registration is based off word of mouth. Therefore,
	misassumptions, false predictions, and regrets plague the stories many students tell others in their advice. However, 
	soley basing your course registration preperation on discussion may be dangerous as rumors over-represent certain classes and under-represent others, as shown by the graph below.

	Above we look through every semester since the beginning of Olin. The green bar represents what the average course size of Olin is from the point of view of students, while the blue bar represents the actual average course size at Olin. This bias occurs as more students take courses with more people (obviously) and therefore there is a redundance in count, causing a perceived larger average course size at Olin. And with biased data in the form of advice is the most prevalent, the tool will be a fresh, unbiased method of observing the 
	course registration process.
