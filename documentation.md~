# Final Documentation

## Main Findings and Outcomes

Olin is a small, young college. The full size is approximately 300 and the earliest batch graduated in 2006. This has resulted in relay of course information by word of mouth, due to limited information on courses. We wanted to provide a more unbiased, informed way of providing course information. We also captured behaviors of each major to help students have easier time deciding on majors.

## Scenario: Picking a Course
Course registration is coming up and TJ can’t decide which classes to take. There are two courses he’s still choosing between, Immunology and Discrete Math. TJ is majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and he will be a junior next Fall. He doesn’t know which courses are best for his major and his grade level. Our project can help by giving TJ statistical insights into the distribution of students in a course and how likely that course is a requirement. No longer will he be lost in indecision.

### Comparing Average Class Size

### Comparing Average Class Student Year

### Observing Class P-Value to Major

![Class P-Value to Major Discrete Math]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mth2110_pvalue.png =400x)
![Class P-Value to Major Immunology]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sci2210_pvalue.png = 400x)

The figures above help TJ to make his decision. He sees that Immunology has a smaller class size, which he likes. On the other hand, Discrete Math is much more important for his major. Both courses are mainly taken by juniors. Now that TJ understands these factors he can make a more educated decision. He chooses to take Discrete Math in order to fulfill his requirements.

## Scenario: Major Analysis

As an ECE major, TJ wants to observe how the courses he took lines up with an average ECE major at Olin by observing the spider diagram that maps each major’s average number of classes taken in each category.

![Bio Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio_spider.png = 200x)

![Design Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/desn_spider.png = 200x)

![EC Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ec_spider.png = 200x)

![ECE Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ece_spider.png = 200x)

![Material Science Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/matsci_spider.png = 200x)

![Mechanical Spiderweb Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me_spider.png = 200x)

He also takes a look at how many students take either Scope of ADE based upon their major.

![ECE Scope ADE Pie]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ECE_sa.png = 200x)

![Mechanical Scope ADE Pie]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ME_sa.png = 200x)

![Design Scope ADE Pie]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ED_sa.png = 200x)

TJ thinks taking Scope may be a good idea, as the majority of the ECEs choose to do so.

## Scenario: Machine Learning a Student’s Major

Lastly, TJ will explore using the machine learning feature to take the classes he took and observe which major he will most likely categorized in based upon the registration data. This feature is unavailable to the general user due to privacy issues.
