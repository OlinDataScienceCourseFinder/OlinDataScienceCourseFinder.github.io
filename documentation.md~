### Project Documentation

## Findings: A Walkthrough of the Course-Finder

Course registration is coming up and TJ can’t decide which classes to take. There are two courses he’s still choosing between, Immunology and Discrete Math. TJ is majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and he will be a junior next Fall. He doesn’t know which courses are best for his major and his grade level. Our project can help by giving TJ statistical insights into the distribution of students in a course and how likely that course is a requirement. No longer will he be lost in indecision.
