### Who We Are

We are a team of students at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. To let students at our school have a simpler time registering for classes, we decided to make a tool where students can gain insight on the registration process. We are basing our tool upon statistics and data analysis, and hope we help the students understand the registration process better, rather than letting them blindly follow recommendations and word of mouth.
