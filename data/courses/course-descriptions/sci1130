This course provides a thorough introduction to classical mechanics. We will cover kinematics, the basis of Newton's laws, particle dynamics, the concepts of momentum, work, energy, and rotational motion, and oscillations. Additionally, the course will establish the basics of solid and fluid mechanics, concluding with introductory topics in thermodynamics. Our goal is to share with you the excitement of discovering the material universe at its most basic levels and to equip you with the basic knowledge and analytical skills necessary to become a scientist or an engineer. This course is offered in two different flavors. Course sections with a prefix of A are taught as Theoretical Mechanics. Course sections with a prefix of B are taught as Experimental Mechanics and are laboratory based.
