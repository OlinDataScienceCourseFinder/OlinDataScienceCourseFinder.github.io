When multiple programs run at the same time, they can interact in complex ways, yielding unpredictable behavior at best and impenetrable bugs at worst. Synchronization is the process of imposing timing constraints in order to guarantee the correct execution of programs. This class presents a series of synchronization "puzzles" and gradually develops a set of tools for dealing with even the hairiest synchronization problems.
