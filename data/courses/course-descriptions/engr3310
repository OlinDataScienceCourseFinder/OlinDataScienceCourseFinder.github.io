This course introduces the basic physics and applications of the transport of heat, mass, and momentum. Topics in fluid dynamics include kinematics, conservation laws, dynamic similarity, and laminar flow solutions. Topics in heat and mass transfer include internal and external convection, free convection, boiling and condensation, and the analogy between heat and mass transport.  Applications in aerodynamics, geophysical flows, manufacturing processes, and biological systems will be discussed.
