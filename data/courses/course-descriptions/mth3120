An introduction to the solution methods of partial differential equations that arise in describing a wide variety of problems in engineering, such as in fluid dynamics, elasticity, electromagnetic wave propagation, and transport phenomena. The course begins with the solution of boundary-value problems in ordinary differential equations (Sturm-Liouville theory), and then develops into the fundamentals of Fourier analysis and the solutions to the heat, wave, and Laplace's equations on finite and infinite domains. Additional topics will be addressed at the discretion of the instructor(s), examples of which include systems of hyperbolic equations, similarity solutions in infinite domains, or a brief introduction to numerical solutions.
