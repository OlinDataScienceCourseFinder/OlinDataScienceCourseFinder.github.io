The Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO) - an ensemble, minus conductor - features instrumentalists in leadership and collaborative roles. Dedicated to orchestral performance in the concerted spirit of chamber music, the orchestra forges individual participation, active listening,and group-motivation into performances that have established it as the only conductorless orchestra of its kind at an American college. (A student can apply up to 4 OCO credits to the 28 required credits in AHSE, or can petition to apply up to 4 OCO credits to the AHS concentration. Any additional credits, i.e., more than 4, earned by a student enrolling in OCO will show up as additional AHS credits, but will not count toward satisfying the requisite 28 credits in AHSE.)
