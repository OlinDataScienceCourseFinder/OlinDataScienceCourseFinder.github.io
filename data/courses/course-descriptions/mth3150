The speed of modern computers has allowed simulation to become a very powerful tool in the design and analysis of systems in science and engineering. This power is easily misused and scientific computing is full of pitfalls. This course introduces students to methods useful for accurately simulating complex systems in the physical sciences and engineering. The first half of the course focuses on iterative techniques for solving algebraic systems, interpolation of functions, and advanced techniques for solutions to ordinary differential equations. The second half of the course focuses on an introduction to solutions to boundary-value problems and solutions to partial differential equations, with the students required to choose an application in science and engineering to solve in detail.
