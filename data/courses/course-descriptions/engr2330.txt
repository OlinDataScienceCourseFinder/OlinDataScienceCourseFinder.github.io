Through project experiences, students will learn the techniques needed to both master the technical communication of mechanical designs and the fabrication skills needed to rapidly build them. Students will practice professional drafting techniques to describe a full range of fabricated components, including milled, lathed, sheet metal, water jet, injection molded, 3D printed and welded components. This course will include a significant machine shop component, where each student will gain exposure to advanced fabrication techniques. The final project will be the design and fabrication of a fully operational, complex mechanical system.
