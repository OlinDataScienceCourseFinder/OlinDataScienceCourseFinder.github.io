In this project-based course, students will develop a personal photographic point of view matched with consistently well-crafted imagery informed by the work of leading contemporary photographers. While communication with visual images is paramount, technical issues will be addressed in some depth. For example, there will be instruction and practice with image capture and editing including High Dynamic Range (HDR) exposure and processing, color management methods and printing, Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop tools and techniques, graphic design and book production methods. Initial projects will stimulate creative thinking and group critiques will help monitor progress and inspire new directions. The culminating project will be the design and production of a photography-based book by each member of the class. A critical awareness of the medium of fine art photography will be fostered through selected readings, discussions, and visits to galleries and museums.
