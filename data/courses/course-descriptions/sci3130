Classical mechanics revisited with the use of mathematical formulation that makes the "old and dusty" Newton's laws shine in all their beauty. Using differential equations and linear algebra tools, we will venture to look at things only hinted at in introductory physics: variational principles, the two-body problem, motion in accelerated frames, rigid body dynamics, oscillations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, continuum mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos.
