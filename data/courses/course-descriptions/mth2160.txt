This course centers on the interdependency of mathematics and the sciences and engineering.
Through this codependency, knowledge of the specific discipline is better understood through the development of a mathematical description and its solution. Often, these descriptions are appropriate over a wide range of disciplines well beyond the original context of the first problem. Over the seven-week session, we look at individual cases in biology, chemistry, physics, fields of engineering and business to see how to formulate a mathematical description, and the techniques used for its solution. The course follows a case-study format, with modeling subjects chosen from the media (for example, the Science Times section of the New York Times).
