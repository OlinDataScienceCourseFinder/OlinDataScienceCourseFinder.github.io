This course covers the principles of statics of structures and mechanics of materials. The focus is on the concepts of stress and strain as related to applied loads (axial, shear, torsion, bending) and to resulting deformation. Students will learn how the principles of mechanics can be applied to mechanical design through modeling, quantitative analysis, strain gauge measurements, and computational simulation. The use of a commercial finite element package is introduced.
