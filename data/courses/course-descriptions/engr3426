This course will provide an overview of mixed-signal (analog and digital) integrated circuit design in modern complementary metal-oxide (CMOS) technologies. Students will learn transistor-level design of digital and analog circuits, layout techniques for digital and analog circuit modules, and special physical considerations that arise in a mixed-signal integrated circuit. Students will design a custom mixed-signal integrated circuit that will be sent out for fabrication at the end of the semester if they enroll in MADVLSI II (ENGR3427).
