The body is a harsh environment for synthetic materials; not only is it warm, wet, and salty, but there are enzymes and cells whose function is to identify and destroy anything foreign. Conversely, implanted materials can provoke unexpected responses from biological systems. This course is an overview of biological interactions with materials, with a special emphasis on the role of the in vivo milieu on failure in medical devices. Topics will include coagulation, inflammation, and immune responses to materials, cell-surface interactions, and the mechanical interactions of materials and tissue, together with emerging fields such as drug delivery and neuron-silicon interfaces. Readings will be drawn primarily from the current literature.
