After undertaking the introductory course in organic chemistry, students will be able to learn more advanced topics and master the reactions of the more biologically-relevant functional groups.
Some of the topics this will include are sugars and carbohydrates, the chemistry of enolates and carbonyls, advanced NMR techniques, and pericyclic reactions. At the end of the course, there will be an introduction to biochemistry from an organic perspective. This course will culminate in a large organic laboratory synthesis that the students will develop and plan themselves for half of the semester.
