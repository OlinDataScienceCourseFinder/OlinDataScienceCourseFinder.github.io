This course uses applications as vehicles for exploring the formal analytic toolkit of the computer scientist as well as aspects of algorithmic computing and intelligent software design. The course combines elements of automata theory, data structures and algorithms, programming languages, artificial intelligence, information management, and internet programming. Students may optionally enroll only in ENGR 3520; these students will be excused from the programming/project component of the course. Students wishing to register for the full six credit course should register for both ENGR 3520 and ENGR 3520A.
