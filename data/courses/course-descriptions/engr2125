The Engineer?s Orchestra provides an introduction to acoustics, waves, and vibrations via musical instruments. Students address the physics of orchestral instruments (winds, strings, and percussion) both qualitatively and quantitatively. Topics include one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal waves, traveling and standing wave solutions to the wave equation, and an introduction to spherical waves with relevant hands-on demonstrations. Modeling and analysis concepts will be introduced to support students in the design and construction of their own physical or virtual musical instruments.
