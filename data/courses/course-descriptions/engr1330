This course covers the fundamentals of machine tool operations, classical machining techniques, and CAD methods. Students will learn principles of technical drawing, fabrication and assembly of mechanical systems, how to interpret and establish appropriate design requirements to make parts to specification and how to inspect parts to ensure that they meet specification. Students will come away with a sound understanding of drawing interpretation and creation, machine shop safety, bench work, measurement, part layout, and machine setup, operation and maintenance.
Assigned projects will involve significant machining time to fabricate mechanical components and a working mechanical system (e.g., tesla turbine).
