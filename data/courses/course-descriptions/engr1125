Conducting experiments and making measurements is an essential aspect of all branches of science and engineering. Nearly all of our current quantitative understanding of the natural and engineered world has come from the interplay between theory and measurements. Models and simulations of systems require experimental validation and performance of engineered systems must not only be predicted, but also measured and tested. In this course we will learn the basic tools of making physical measurements and conducting experiments. We will collect data, analyze data, conduct basic error analysis, and design experimental systems. Using inexpensive modern sensors, we will build the necessary supporting electronics and learn to collect data with computer based data acquisition systems. The first part of the course will focus on individual work and students will conduct labs on basic electrical, mechanical and environmental measurements. The later part of the course will involve a team project that involves designing and executing an experiment that involves measurement, data acquisition and data analysis.
