Error-control codes are used to detect and correct errors that occur when data are transmitted across a noisy channel. This course provides an introduction to error-control codes, including linear, cyclic, binary, and non-binary codes. Mathematics such as modular arithmetic and introductory ring and field theory will be introduced and used extensively. Students must simultaneously enroll in MTH 3140 and ENGR 3140 for a total of 4 credit hours.
