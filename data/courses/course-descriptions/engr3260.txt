In the process of creating a new product, device or system, a "proof of principle" prototype is built to demonstrate both that such an object can be built and to test how well it works. At a practical level, in the process of creating this prototype, many sub-optimal design concessions are made in the choices of components, cost and functionality in order to meet prototyping time and budget constraints. Upon the completion and successful testing of a prototype, the next phase in the design stream required to bring the product, device or system to a final user or market, is to re-design the prototype such that it can be manufactured at both an acceptably low price point and at an acceptably high enough level of quality to give enduring value to the final end user.
Design for Manufacturing will build the specialized design skills needed to professionally redesign a prototype in order to meet target price, reliability and functionality goals, whether the final market requires a single unit per year (i.e. space systems, like satellites) or fifty thousand units a week (i.e. consumer products).  This course will be heavily team and project based and will involve the re-design for manufacture of several products, devices and services at the discretion of the instructor. The overall course projects will incorporate a significant mechanical, electronic and software components (but perhaps not all three in any one project) and will be drawn widely from the consumer, industrial, and sustainable market sectors. Course will potentially involve field trips to manufacturing facilities and invited "DFM " lecturers as appropriate to support the particular projects offered in a given semester.
