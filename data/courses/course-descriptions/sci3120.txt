Why do metals conduct heat well while insulators do not? Why is silicon a better semiconductor than diamond, even though they have the same structure? Why is lead a good superconductor at low temperature, while copper is not? We will explore the current understanding of insulators, metals, semiconductors and superconductors through some of the basic tools of solid state physics, and will learn how to apply these tools to the novel materials being developed today.
