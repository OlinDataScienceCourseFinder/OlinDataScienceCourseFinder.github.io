How is a blood vessel like a garden hose? Why are seashells strong (and beautiful) even though they are made of chalk? How can your opaque white tendons be made of the same material as your transparent corneas? This course focuses on the materials science of natural tissues, primarily ones that fill structural roles, including bone, teeth, tendon, nacre, and wood, with an emphasis on how they are similar and different to 'engineering' materials. Additional material may include scaffolds for tissue engineering, biomimetic materials and mechanical properties of individual cells.
