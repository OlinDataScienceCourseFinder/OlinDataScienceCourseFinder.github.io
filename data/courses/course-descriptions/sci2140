When it was first introduced, Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity rocked the foundations of classical physics with a plethora of "paradoxes" such as identical twins who could have different biological ages. Like swimming or bicycle riding, Special Relativity can be completely mastered without formal physics prerequisites, and this course will be taught from first principles that do not require any specialized physics knowledge. This approach will naturally lead to an introduction of General Relativity, including some characteristics of Black Holes.
