Students get the best preparation for their career by obtaining real life experience, preferably in a work setting. This course would require an international student (F-1 visa status) seeking this type of meaningful, career-building internship to receive the necessary career preparation by way of PGP workshops, obtaining the necessary internal authorizations, and completing, along with their employer, a final work experience evaluation. At least 100 work hours would be required at the internship. In addition, the student must participate in at least two Post Graduate Planning workshops. If two of these are not available, the student may take similar, related workshops, or meet with PGP individually to cover the required material.
