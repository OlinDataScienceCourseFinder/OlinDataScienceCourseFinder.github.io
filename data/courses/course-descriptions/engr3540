The availability of cheap computation has created a new way of understanding the world. Along with experiment and theory, computational modeling provides new tools for analysis, explanation and prediction. This class looks at the history of this revolution and the technology that underlies it. We will survey a range of literature, from the skeptical to the exuberant, and make a critical evaluation of this putative paradigm shift. Students will learn the skills of computational modeling, with an emphasis on discrete and stochastic models, and apply them to problems in a range of fields including engineering and the natural and social sciences. Basic programming ability, in any language, is a prerequisite.
