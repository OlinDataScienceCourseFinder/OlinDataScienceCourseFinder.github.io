This course will focus on the modern theory of dynamical systems including both discrete and continuous processes. The course will emphasize both theory and applications. Theory topics might include, for example, linear and nonlinear stability theory, periodic solutions, bifurcation theory, chaos, and strange attractors. Applications discussed might include, for example, mechanical oscillators and biological oscillators.
