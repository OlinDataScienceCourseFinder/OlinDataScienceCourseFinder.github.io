This course offers the opportunity to begin researching your proposed AHS Capstone project topic, plan logistics, and write a proposal prior to enrolling in the AHS Capstone project. Students will work on a series of tasks throughout this semester in an independent manner, and can solicit feedback from other students in this course, Capstone teaching assistants, and Capstone teaching staff. Tasks include identification of the project area/topic and mentor, production of a partial annotated bibliography (that contextualizes each source with respect to one or more scholarly disciplines), and a detailed Capstone proposal (which includes a project statement, thesis, plan of work, etc.).
