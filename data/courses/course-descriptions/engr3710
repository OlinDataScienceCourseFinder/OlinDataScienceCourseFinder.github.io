This course introduces students to the art and science of interdisciplinary design. Students analyze the process used to develop example products that required expertise in many areas and creativity and trade-off consideration amongst all. Students learn about overarching principles that enable creators of broad interdisciplinary systems to succeed. Students will also work in teams and take on roles as design specialists in a variety of fields. Each team is given the task to design in detail a hypothetical product that can succeed only if interdisciplinary creativity is fostered and tradeoffs are made by every team member, as well as the group as a whole.
