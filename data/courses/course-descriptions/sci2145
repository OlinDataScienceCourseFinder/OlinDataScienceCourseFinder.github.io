The universe is full of hot stuff! The oldest radiation that we can measure originally arose where the temperature was only thousands of degrees, but there is indirect evidence for the early universe that requires temperatures of trillions of degrees. As the universe expands and cools there are still occasional (but quite frequent) episodes involving temperatures of millions or even billions of degrees that are manifested in phenomena like supernovae and black holes. These high energy episodes are not just curiosities: supernovae are responsible for most of the chemical elements associated with life on Earth, and giant black holes are present at the cores of virtually all galaxies. This course will examine how the theoretical and empirical study of X-rays and gamma-rays can probe the high energy universe.
