This course introduces students to key concepts and methods in cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the study of how humans organize their lives as members of society, and the ways in which they make these lives meaningful. Through readings on such diverse topics as adolescence in Samoa, epilepsy among Hmong-Americans, and McDonald's in Hong Kong, this course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to three central questions: 1) What is culture? 2) Does "culture" explain why people do what they do and believe what they believe? 3) What fate and value do cultural differences have in today's interconnected world?
