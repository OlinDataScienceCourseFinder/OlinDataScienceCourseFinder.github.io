Students will complete projects and case studies to gain practical experience in the analysis of fractured and failed engineering materials and components. The course focus will be on material microstructure and the micromechanisms of fracture, and topics will include failure analysis methodology, mechanisms of failure, fracture classifications, corrosion and environmental factors, fractography, and design for failure prevention. Students will learn advanced materials characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and compositional dot mapping, x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), optical microscopy, and fracture surface sample preparation.
