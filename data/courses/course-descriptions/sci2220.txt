Why is a giraffe's head so small in comparison to the rest of its body? Why do babies' heads flatten when they sleep in the same position? Why do knees bend only in one direction? Why are people taller in the morning? In this course, we will study the nature and function of human body and its movement with specific emphasis on movements produced in sport, dance, and every day physical activities. The principles of Newtonian mechanics, statics, and dynamics will be applied to discuss behavior of bones, tendons, ligaments, and muscles during human movement.
This course is cross-listed as ENGR 2620.
