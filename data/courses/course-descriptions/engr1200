We take nature, an important source of inspiration and understanding, as a theme and develop bioinspired ideas into functional prototypes. Our focus is on the general principles and methods that shape the practice of engineering design. Students complete individual and team projects in a studio environment where we seek to develop a shared practice and understanding of engineering design. Students also gain experience in visualization, experimentation, estimation, fabrication, and presentation as they relate to designing.
