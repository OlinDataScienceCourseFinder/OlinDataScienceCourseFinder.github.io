This course will provide a computationally-focused introduction to the field of robotics. Students will learn how to both select and design algorithms for solving interesting problems in robotic perception and control. Additionally, students will learn to successfully balance tradeoffs between accuracy of an algorithm and its computational efficiency in both space and time. The course will move from structured labs to more open-ended projects as the semester progresses. Specific content areas that the course may address are: computer vision, machine learning, reinforcement learning, path planning, mapping and localization.
1) This course may be used as an E: Computing elective in an updated Plan of Study.
2) This new Robotics course increases flexibility in the E:Robotics concentration.  Depending on a student's background, either ENGR3390: Fundamentals of Robotics OR ENGR3590: An Introduction to Computational Robotics may be used as an introductory course.
