Throughout this semester we will use different history of technology narratives to explore larger themes.  Our narrative case studies will range from bronze age societal studies to cutting edge computing and Internet technologies, and throughout the semester we will compare and contrast these narratives in search of larger trends.  We will also identify and investigate broader issues such as large technological systems; paradigms and scientific revolutions; technologies and political values; ethical theories; and the environmental and sustainability implications of technologies.  Throughout the semester we will engage these narratives and broader issues through targeted writing activities, debates, individual and group presentations, at least one field trip, movie and media studies, and numerous in-class discussions.  Students will have a high degree of autonomy, and will set and evaluate their own learning objectives, determine the topic for final projects, and design and facilitate in-class activities throughout the semester.
