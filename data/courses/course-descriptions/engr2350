This course covers the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and physical chemistry as applied to engineering systems. This course provides a foundation in fundamental thermodynamic phenomena, including the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thermodynamic properties, equations of state in real and ideal gases, and chemical equilibrium. The basic laws are used to understand and analyze the performance and efficiency of systems, such as automobile engines, gas turbines, steam power plants, and refrigerators.
