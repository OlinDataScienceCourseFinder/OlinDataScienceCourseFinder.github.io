This course is an introduction to the tremendous diversity of the microbial world and its applications.  Topics include: bacterial growth, energy metabolism, nutrient cycling, symbiosis, bioremediation, biofilm formation, and techniques for culturing and working with bacteria.  This course approaches the study of environmental bacteria and their metabolic, physiological and genetic diversity through primary literature and laboratory work.  Students will learn biochemical, molecular and bioinformatics techniques for working with microbial systems.  Students will explore the microbial world first through guided laboratory exercises followed by development of individual and group special laboratory projects.  Students will develop working knowledge of microbiology that may be applied to a range of situations, from study of systems were microbes are a problem to development of biological solutions using microbes.
