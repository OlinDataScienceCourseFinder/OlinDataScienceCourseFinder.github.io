You will work with industrial design students from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design (in Boston) and business students from Babson College to develop new products through projects that are student-generated. Students learn first hand about the techniques and contributions different disciplines bring to product design and practice cross-functional collaboration common in professional design settings. This course provides valuable preparation for students interested to work in design firms, such as Continuum, IDEO, Frog, Altitude and Essential to name a few, or develop and launch their own consumer products. Class will be held once a week and rotate among all three campuses. Babson students should enroll in MOB 3578. Wellesley students should cross-register into this course and not MOB 3578 at Babson.
