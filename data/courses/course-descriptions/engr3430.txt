Through a series of projects, we will learn to design, build, and debug electronic prototype systems. We will cover multiple aspects of the prototyping process, including circuit and system design, soldering, deadbugging, troubleshooting, component selection, schematic capture, printed-circuit board (PCB) layout, PCB fabrication, PCB assembly, and thermal analysis. We will discuss the tradeoffs among "faster, better, cheaper", and explore examples in the realms of analog, digital, RF, and power. In addition to hands-on reverse engineering and fabrication experience, students will learn technical communication through design documentation. This course is approved for use as an advanced ECE elective.
