This course encompasses the fundamentals of perception, sensors, computer vision, navigation, localization, actuation, manipulation, mobility (e.g., walk, swim, roll, crawl, fly), and intelligence (e.g., control, planning, and mission execution). The course is built around the review and discussion of seminal technical papers in the robotics field with guest lecturers both from various Olin faculty and from external leaders in the robotics community. There is a significant project component to help solidify key concepts.
