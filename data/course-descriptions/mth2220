An intradisciplinary approach that builds upon material covered in Linearity 1 to address topics in vector calculus and introductory partial differential equations.  Topics include functions of more than one variable; vector-valued functions; gradient, divergence, and curl; boundaryvalue problems; and solutions to common partial differential equations.  Emphasis on both numerical and analytical approaches.  Note: students who have previously taken multi-variable calculus should consult with mathematics faculty to determine whether taking Linearity 2 is appropriate for their needs.
