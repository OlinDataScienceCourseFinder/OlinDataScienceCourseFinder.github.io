This course combines the components of Fundamentals of Robotics (sensing, cognition and actuation) into the testing and deployment of fully-working interdisciplinary robotic systems. There is a significant lab-based component in which teams of students compete in several main industrial robotics areas to optimize mission performance under real world time constraints.  
Previous projects include: the design of a robot arm and vision system that plays checkers against human opponents; the design of closed-loop-controlled unmanned ground vehicles to autonomously circumnavigate the Olin Oval, and the design of an intelligent assembly system for autonomous processing of multi-well bio-assay trays.
