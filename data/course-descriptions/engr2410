Linear system theory is a powerful set of mathematical tools used broadly across science and engineering. Signals represent the transfer of information or power, while systems represent operations on these signals. This course presents fundamental concepts from linear systems such as convolution, impulse and step response, Fourier transforms, sampling and modulation. These concepts are presented within the framework of linear operators and/or transforms in discrete and/or continuous time. Applications include filters, system identification, deconvolution, feedback and control, and communications.
