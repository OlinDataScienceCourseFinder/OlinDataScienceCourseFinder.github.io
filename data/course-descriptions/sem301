Have you ever wanted to make a thing, but had absolutely no idea how to get started designing it? Have you ever wondered why McMaster-Carr has 8,215 parts called "Machine Screws", gotten upset about why there could possibly be so many, and despaired at the thought of ever finding the appropriate fastener for your project? Do you want to be able to design simple, effective structures on your own without needing to spend multiple semesters in the Mechanical Engineering curriculum? This course is for you.
In Fundamentals of Mechanical Design, we'll go over the basics of structural design, material selection, parts selection, and component sizing, with the practical goal of enabling students to design simple, robust assemblies on their own by the end of class. The class will include optional design challenges throughout the semester, designed to demonstrate basic concepts of mechanical engineering like structural design, power transmission, and mechanism design.
