This project-based course provides students with a chance to apply and integrate the concepts and the tools of business, engineering, and the liberal arts (science, social science, and the humanities) to address sustainability. It is team-taught by three faculty members, one from each institution, with coursework fully integrated across the three approaches. Students will work in multi-campus groups on a project with a client throughout the semester, along with common readings and discussions about processes and project stages taking place in class time.
