This course is an introduction to quantum physics. Although quantum physics is the most successful description of natural phenomena that has ever been devised, quantum "reality" is so intuitively frustrating that Nobel laureate Richard Feynman once famously said: "Nobody understands quantum mechanics!" The course material includes the origin and development of quantum mechanics and quantum statistics, with the goal of providing an appreciation for the quantum rationale for the structure and characteristics of nuclei, atoms, molecules, fluids and solids (including semiconductors).  With permission of instructor, this course can be used for Physics Foundation credit.
