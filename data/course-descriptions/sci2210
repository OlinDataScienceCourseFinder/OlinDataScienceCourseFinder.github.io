Immunology is a relatively new science, and our understanding of our immune system is evolving at a rapid pace. When the immune system functions properly, infectious pathogens and potential cancer cells are destroyed. When our immune system malfunctions, normally harmless microorganisms can cause serious infections, autoimmune diseases or allergies can develop and cancer cells can evade immune surveillance and grow unchecked. In this lecture and discussion-based class, we will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control our immune responses. Current research in immunology will be emphasized through analysis of primary literature and media articles.
