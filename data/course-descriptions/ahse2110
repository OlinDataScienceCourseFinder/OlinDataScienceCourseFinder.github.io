The lion's share of our history of technology course features a series of readings, lectures, and discussions on the relationship between materials, science, society, and the environment in three historical periods. We start with the material practices and paradigms of Copper and Bronze Age societies, shift to Paul Revere's "Revolutionary" work with various metals and fabrication processes, and conclude with a look at the technologies and challenges of tomorrow. We will emphasize the development of three skills that are vital to our studies: contextual thinking, communication (both written and oral), and historical research methods pertaining to source evaluation and narrative construction.
