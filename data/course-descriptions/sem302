Have you ever wanted to design a system that can lift 10 pounds? How about 100 pounds? How about 100,000 pounds? Do you have any applications that call for controlled linear motion, and are you at a loss for how to make a motor do such a thing effectively? Do you want to learn about how to move stuff around without using electric motors? Take Introduction to Pneumatic and Hydraulic Systems.
In this class, we'll learn the basics of system design, component sizing, part sourcing, and assembly of pneumatic (air powered) and hydraulic (liquid powered) systems. These types of systems are relatively easy to design if you know where to look for parts, are easy to control with binary logic, and are immensely useful in robotics, factory automation, and other motion control applications. The practical goal of the class will be to give students the ability to size, design, order, and (safely) assemble a pneumatic and hydraulic system from scratch.
