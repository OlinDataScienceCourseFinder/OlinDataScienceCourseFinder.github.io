Fundamental techniques for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of mechanical and aerospace structures are studied through case projects that involve both computational analysis and experimental measurements. Topics will be selected from areas such as vibration analysis, flexible body dynamics, aerodynamics, and aero-elasticity. Projects may include the design and construction of vibration absorbers or energy harvesting systems, the dynamics and stability of aerospace vehicles, lift and drag of airfoils, or flutter instability of elastic structures.
