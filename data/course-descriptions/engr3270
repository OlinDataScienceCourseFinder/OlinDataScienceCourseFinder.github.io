This course is intended to completely re-imagine the product design + entrepreneurship process. Each participant in the course will imagine, design, prototype, test, market and sell a product in the span of the semester. The products and customers will be real. A key measure of success will be the number of products successfully sold and shipped to complete strangers. To achieve these lofty goals, we will have to explore, understand and analyze each element of existing processes with an eye towards exploiting best practices, redesigning them when relevant and, if needed, creating processes anew.
