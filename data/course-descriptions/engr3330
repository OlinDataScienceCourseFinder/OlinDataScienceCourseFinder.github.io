This course integrates basic mechanical sciences for application to machine design. Topics include stress, strain, deflection, stiffness, and failure of mechanical components including springs, bearings, gears, shafts and axles; steady and time-dependent loading; mechanical fastening and joining; and power transmission. Techniques for quantitative analysis and design optimization are introduced. The material of this course significantly draws and builds upon the concepts presented in ENGR 2320.  Students will carry out a major design project.
